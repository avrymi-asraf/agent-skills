# Agent Skills

A curated collection of production-grade AI agent skills compatible with the [Skills CLI](https://skills.sh) (`npx skills`).

These skills provide structured workflows, MCP tool wrappers, best practices, and runtime extensions for AI coding agents such as **Claude Code**, **Cursor**, **Codex**, **OpenCode**, and **Antigravity**.

---

## Installation & Usage

### 1. Install via Skills CLI (`npx skills`)

Install skills directly into your local project:

```bash
# Add skills interactively
npx skills add avrymi-asraf/agent-skills

# List all available skills in this repo
npx skills add avrymi-asraf/agent-skills --list

# Install a specific skill (e.g. wiki-llm)
npx skills add avrymi-asraf/agent-skills --skill wiki-llm

# Install multiple specific skills
npx skills add avrymi-asraf/agent-skills --skill wiki-llm code-as-tools coding-principles

# Install all skills non-interactively
npx skills add avrymi-asraf/agent-skills --all
```

### 2. Global Installation

Install globally to make skills available across all projects on your machine:

```bash
npx skills add avrymi-asraf/agent-skills -g
```

### 3. Target Specific Agents

Specify which agent environment to install to (e.g. Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, Codex):

```bash
npx skills add avrymi-asraf/agent-skills --agent claude-code cursor
```

## Skills Catalog

| Skill | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [`agent-and-skill-improvement`](skills/agent-and-skill-improvement) | Maintains and improves agent files (identity, memory, tools) and skill files (`SKILL.md`). Load when completing tasks that produce learnings, updating agent behavior, or refining domain knowledge. |
| [`architecture-map`](skills/architecture-map) | Generates production-quality interactive self-contained HTML architecture diagrams and agent-ready JSON from codebases. |
| [`chatreplay`](skills/chatreplay) | Parses and interprets `.chatreplay.json` session logs capturing interactions between users, AI agents (VS Code / Copilot), and tools. |
| [`code-as-tools`](skills/code-as-tools) | Guides writing research and exploratory code as small, composable, notebook-friendly tools rather than rigid pipelines. |
| [`coding-principles`](skills/coding-principles) | Fundamental principles for code clarity, naming uniformity, live execution, and clean architecture without unnecessary refactoring. |
| [`colab-cli`](skills/colab-cli) | Manages Google Colab cloud runtimes, secrets, remote execution, and SSH access directly via the Colab CLI in agentic workflows. |
| [`create-qa-spectrum`](skills/create-qa-spectrum) | Streams, filters, and selects diverse reasoning QA datasets across multiple reasoning families, pushing them to Hugging Face. |
| [`gemini-deep-research`](skills/gemini-deep-research) | Local MCP server for Google Gemini Deep Research interactions with explicit start, status polling, and file handling. |
| [`jira-workflow`](skills/jira-workflow) | Jira issue tracking workflow — search, read, create, update issues, plan implementations, and reference commit tickets. |
| [`manage-mcp`](skills/manage-mcp) | Guides designing and implementing focused Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools and integrating them into agent skills. |
| [`manage-skills`](skills/manage-skills) | Rules and quality patterns for creating, auditing, modifying, and improving Agent Skills (`SKILL.md`). |
| [`notebook-observability`](skills/notebook-observability) | Uses Jupyter notebooks as live observability playgrounds for production systems and AI pipelines while keeping them in sync with real APIs. |
| [`opencode-runtime-hooks`](skills/opencode-runtime-hooks) | Runtime architecture analysis and hook authoring guide for OpenCode sessions, agents, and tool execution lifecycle. |
| [`pdf-to-markdown-mcp`](skills/pdf-to-markdown-mcp) | Local MCP server converting PDFs to Markdown using Gemini or Ollama vision models with high-fidelity equation and table extraction. |
| [`project-agent-systems`](skills/project-agent-systems) | Builds project-local agent, skill, MCP, and memory setups across OpenCode, Copilot, and Codex without polluting global settings. |
| [`research-and-experiments`](skills/research-and-experiments) | Workflows and structure for formulating hypotheses, designing experiments, logging metrics, and drawing compounding conclusions. |
| [`scripts`](skills/scripts) | Guides creation of operational Python (uv / PEP 723) and JS scripts for AWS/CDN environments with security and session handling. |
| [`tasks`](skills/tasks) | Task runner automation using Python-native `invoke` and `uv` inline PEP 723 dependencies to replace legacy Makefiles. |
| [`wiki-llm`](skills/wiki-llm) | Implements Karpathy's compounding LLM wiki pattern — synthesizing raw documents into an interlinked markdown knowledge base. |
